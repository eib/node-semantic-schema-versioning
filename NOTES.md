### TODOs

 * Create a ".schema-versioning.json" file at the root of the "project".
  * Use this to set the schema directory
 * Think of a good command-line tool name: svs (semantically versioning schema)
 * Implement the remaining scripts:
  * scaffolding
  * verify
  * revert
 * Unit-tests, of course
 * Write up the "spec"
